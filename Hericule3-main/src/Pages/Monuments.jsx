          Made of red and pink sandstone, Jaipur's signature palace of unusual
          architecture is a stunning example of local artistry. The top of the
          Hawa Mahal offers an excellent view over the city.It was designed by
          Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with
          its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate
          latticework.The original intent of the lattice design was to allow
          royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the
          street below without being seen.{" "}

          Bhomia,whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of
          the fort. The fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became
          known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'.{" "}
